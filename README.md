## About the Project
**Video Talker** is a web application designed for real-time video calls using WebRTC technology. This project leverages **Node.js** for server-side operations, **React** for the user interface, and **Redux** for state management.

### Features
- Real-time video and audio streaming.
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) high-quality video calls using WebRTC.
- Browser-based video conferencing.
- Application state management with Redux.
- Server-side management with Node.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management library for React applications.
- **WebRTC**: Real-time communication technology for peer-to-peer connections.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Markup and styling for the UI.
